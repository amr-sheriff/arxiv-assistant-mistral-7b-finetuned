    "\n",
    "This notebook is tailored to perform a simple inference for the VLLM inference server endpoint. It demonstrates how to interact with the deployed model using both the OpenAI API format and direct HTTP requests, showcasing the model's capabilities in handling arXiv-related queries and generating relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is designed to be a practical tool for testing the deployed model's performance, response quality, inference speed, tokens utilization, and API functionality. It offers examples of prompts and response parsing, which can be valuable for both development and qualitative evaluation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook includes the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup and Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Imports necessary libraries such as openai and requests.\n",
    "   - Sets up authentication by retrieving API tokens and endpoint URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OpenAI Client Interface**:\n",
    "   - Demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Python client to interact with the VLLM endpoint.\n",
    "   - Configures the client with the appropriate API key and base URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chat Completion Request**:\n",
    "   - Implements a chat completion request using the OpenAI client.\n",
    "   - Shows how to structure prompts and handle model parameters like temperature and max tokens.\n",

    "4. **HTTP POST Request Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Provides a custom function to send HTTP POST requests directly to the VLLM endpoint.\n",
    "   - Demonstrates how to structure the payload and headers for the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Handling and Parsing**:\n",
    "   - Processes and displays the model's responses.\n",
    "   - Extracts relevant information from the JSON responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Example Queries and Outputs**:\n",
    "   - Includes sample prompts related to arXiv papers and scientific topics.\n",
